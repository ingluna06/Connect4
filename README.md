Started from a simple test app in which I wanted to use a GridLayout, but then I saw the potential.

Basically it's a simple "Connect 4" game but with a little twist &mdash; it technically allows for a board with any number of rows and columns and any number of disks in a continuous line required to win.

I'm really proud of the algorithm I wrote to check for winners which can check on any row/column/diagonal for that line of same disks needed to win.

Took me long enough to complete, undergoing major refactoring several types, but the end result is just awesome!

As sounds for winning / tie I've used:
